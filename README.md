# Final-Project
Team members: Cassidy Hay

For this project, I chose to do option 3: Analyzing a dataset that uses data 
wrangling and modeling tools in R. I will use a dataset on maternal health risk
data.

Data

Data has been collected from different hospitals, community clinics, maternal 
health cares through the IoT based risk monitoring system.

Age: Age in years when a woman is pregnant.
SystolicBP: Upper value of Blood Pressure in mmHg, another significant attribute 
  during pregnancy.
DiastolicBP: Lower value of Blood Pressure in mmHg, another significant 
  attribute during pregnancy.
BS: Blood glucose levels is in terms of a molar concentration, mmol/L.
HeartRate: A normal resting heart rate in beats per minute.
Risk Level: Predicted Risk Intensity Level during pregnancy considering the 
  previous attribute.
  
Goal

I hope to utilize the topics taught in this class to evaluate which health 
conditions are the strongest indications for health risks during pregnancy.

Plan

I will reshape the data, create a data frame, visualize the relationships, and
build a linear regression model.
